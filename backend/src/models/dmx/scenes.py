    """
    Represent a static lighting snapshot or 'look' within the system.

    A Scene serves as a data container for specific fixture intensities, 
    colours, and positions. Unlike a :class:`Cue`, which manages timing 
    and sequence logic, a Scene focuses strictly on the state of the 
    lighting rig at a given moment. 

    It organises fixture data through associations, allowing multiple 
    cues to potentially reference the same visual state, thus promoting 
    data reusability across a show.

    :param id: Unique identifier for the scene, utilising UUID v7.
    :type id: uuid.UUID
    :param sid: The Scene ID (Short ID), typically used for quick console 
        commands or numerical sorting.

class SceneFixtureValue(Base):
    """
    Represent the specific value of a fixture attribute within a scene.

    This model serves as the atom of the lighting control system, mapping 
    a single physical or virtual attribute (such as Dimmer, Red, or Pan) 
    to a concrete DMX value. 

    A collection of these values constitutes a complete :class:`Scene`. 
    By decoupling attributes from the fixture itself, the system allows 
    for transparent control and granular updates to complex lighting rigs.

    :param id: Unique identifier for this attribute-value pair,
